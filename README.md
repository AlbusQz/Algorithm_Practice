最近发现自己写代码手很生，离开浏览器就不会了，准备拾起来，没事的时候练练手？（大概一天一道（希望、祈求我能坚持下来🙃））

I've recently come to realize that my hands are very raw when it comes to writing code. Sometimes I can't leave the browser, so I'm going to pick it up and practice it when I am free? (About one a day (fingers crossed I can stick to it 🙃 ))
